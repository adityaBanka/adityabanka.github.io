The CI/CD pipepline is very streamlined and updates can be pushed directly via the github repository. Even though it is a static website, I have implemented a contact system using AWS lambda along with AWS Simple Email Service. I gave special emphasis on making the design reactive, responsive and consistent.</p>,

In the project I was tasked with developing a novel solution to detect sexism in memes. This was done using the EXIST&apos;24 dataset. I worked under the guidance of Dr J. P.

      description: <p>This C program is able to sort 1 Billion signed integers i.e. 3.45GB of data in about 20 seconds. It is a multi-processed program that dynamically creates new proceess based on load and requirement. By leveraging all CPU cores on a system it uses in-place quick sort methods. This reduces the overhead caused by other methods like merge sort, or heap sort. First all 1 Billion integers are loaded in a shared memory segment that will be used by all the parallel proceess. Then by usilizing divide and conquer the data is divided into smaller segments and recursively sorted.</p>,

In due time, the simulation finds the fittest individuals, crosses them over and mutates them. After a few generation the property to solve the given maze, gets ingrained in the genes of the agents.</p>
