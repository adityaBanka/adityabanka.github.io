      title: <p>Q. Can <span className='text-4xl text-rose-400'>Evolution</span> solve mazes.</p>,
      description: <p>A. Yes! it can. A Java program that simulates evolution using Genetic algorithm. I first create a population of agents that are initialized with random genes. In due time, the simulation finds the fittest individuals, crosses them over and mutates them. After a few generation the property to traverse a given path, gets ingrained in the genes of the agents.</p>,

      description: <p>This C program is able to sort 1 Billion signed integers i.e. 3.45GB of data in about 20 seconds. It is a multi-processed program that dynamically creates new process based on load and requirement. By leveraging all CPU cores on a system it uses in-place quick sort methods. This reduces the overhead caused by other methods like merge sort, or heap sort. First all 1 Billion integers are loaded in a shared memory segment that will be used by all the parallel processes. Then by utilizing divide and conquer the data is divided into smaller segments and recursively sorted.</p>,

      description: <p>Over the summer of 23 I was fascinated by fractals and their property to make geometric patters from simple rules. I then wrote a few rules of my own and explored how these patters evolve over different parameters. During one of those exploratory run, I was able to produce a function that was able to make organic looking emergent structures from very simple function using randomness at its core.</p>,

It is a simple simulation that uses 3 simple rules applied over an infinite grid. The &apos;game&apos; explored the idea of emergent life in simple cellular automaton and how it can be used to create complex, almost life like &apos;creatures&apos;.</p>,

Even they are do no come close to the best possible, that is Ray casting, a technique that is exponentially more compute extensive that both, but producing completely natural looking environments by projecting beams of light not from the point of observation but from the point of emission.</p>,

I then implemented both of them and compared their performance. The results were quite surprising, Genetic Algorithm was able to find the global optimum in a much shorter time than Gradient Descent for the chosen task.</p>,
