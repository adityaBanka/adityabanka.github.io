      title: <p>Q. Can <span className='text-4xl text-rose-400'>Evolution</span> solve mazes?</p>,
      description: <p>A. Yes! it can. This is a Java program simulates evolution using Genetic algorithm. I first create a population of agents that are initialized with random genes. In due time, the simulation finds the fittest individuals, crosses them over and mutates them. After a few generation the property to traverse a given path, gets ingrained in the genes of the agents.</p>,

      description: <p>This C program is able to sort 1 Billion signed integers i.e. 3.45GB of data in about 20 seconds. It is multi-processed and can dynamically create new process based on load and requirement. This is achieved by leveraging all CPU cores on a system and using in-place quick sort method. This also reduces the overhead caused by other methods like merge sort, or heap sort. First all 1 Billion integers are loaded in a shared memory segment that will be used by all the parallel processes. Then by utilizing divide and conquer the data is divided into smaller segments and recursively sorted.</p>,

      description: <p>Over the summer of 23 I was fascinated by fractals and their property to make geometric patters from atomic rules. I then wrote a few rules of my own and explored how these patterns evolve over different parameters. During one of those exploratory runs, I was able to produce a function that could make organic looking structures using randomness at it&apos;s core.</p>,

It is a simulation that uses 3 simple rules applied over an infinite grid. The &apos;game&apos; explored the idea of emergent life through cellular automaton and how it can be used to create complex, almost life like &apos;creatures&apos;.</p>,

      description: <p>Conventional graphics are illuminated using light maps, which is a raster technique, the non conventional but better option is ray tracing. Even they are do no come close to the best possible, that is Ray casting, a technique that is exponentially more compute extensive, but produces completely natural looking environments by projecting beams of light not from the point of observation but from the point of emission.</p>,

      description: <p>One of the most commonly used algorithm for pathfinding is Depth First Search (DFS). But what if there are no nodes? Here I have used DFS to create a graph rather than traverse it. This let&apos;s me create Mazes and other interesting structures, while also deepening my understanding of these elegant algorithms.</p>,

I then devoted my time understanding the differences between Genetic Algorithm and Gradient Descent. After which implemented both of them and compared their performance. The findings were very counter-intuitive, Genetic Algorithm was able to find the global optimum in much shorter training time than Gradient Descent for the chosen task.</p>,

This is a ReactJs website styled using TailwindCSS, hosted on github pages, being linked to my custom domain on Wix.com. The CI/CD pipeline is very streamlined and updates can be pushed directly via the github repository. Even though it is a static website, I have implemented a contact system using AWS lambda along with AWS Simple Email Service. I gave special emphasis on making the design reactive, responsive and consistent.</p>,
